# Primary takeaways 
1. Tech Distractions
2. Sleep Deprivation
3. Multi-Tasking
4. Parental Overinvolvement
5. Fear of wrong choices
6. (Not mentioned but I think it counts) Inability to know what 'good' looks like

## Summary
The main point is you need to create a scaffolding so the kid can succeed and know "this is what success looks like"

And then remove the scaffolding step by step so they can incrementally know how to adjust for each change internally.

## Key Ideas
- THe primary issue that boys face is that they are behind developmentally and "trying harder" doesn't actually result in better success
- In a world of multi tasking, reducing sensation overload might be the trick
- It takes a long time to change behavior.
- The book has a list of archetypes that should help determine proper pathways.

## Archtypes I think I fall into
1. Overscheduled Procrastinator
2. Tech Master
3. Intellectual Conversationalist
